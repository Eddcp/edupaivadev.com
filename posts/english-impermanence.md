### Beginning, middle, end.

Birth, growth, death.

Once, I attended a lecture by a Buddhist monk and learned a little more about impermanence. At that time, I was going through a recent breakup and already getting involved with someone else (a complicated story for another post, haha), and this lecture was a very interesting turning point in my life.

It was funny because even though I realized I was trying to cling to someone to fill a void, I tried to look at it from a perspective that it would work out in the end. I was following the expression "beating a dead horse," as they like to say. During the lecture, I could understand that even that infatuation would eventually come to an end.

Everything is transient, everything tends to end. This is the concept of Anicca, one of the main concepts for describing the universe according to Buddhism. Before you dismiss this text due to aversion to the topic of religion, please stay a little longer to try to see it from another perspective. I want to tell you that I don't have a religion or a clear opinion about the existence of God. I have a somewhat syncretic view of things, but I am fascinated by how individuals organize themselves to try to explain the universe. So, focus on analyzing the concept and not the whole. Once you understand that everything tends to come to an end, you can better cope with the challenges of life.

We finish our school years, our college years, our jobs. We change friends and places, we experience things, and all of these have an end. I had a relationship, had friends I swore I would never drift apart from, had beliefs that changed as life went on, had certainties that turned into doubts, and today the only certainty I have is change.

### Apocalipsters, Lives na Twitch, Fresno

**[Apocalipsters](https://open.spotify.com/show/55NnEz9rm1UnRmXf1cK64J?si=TNCKOvBHRqG4EBHshrrCdA&nd=1)** was a podcast project I was part of. I learned a lot and had the opportunity to exchange ideas with diverse people. But there came a point where things just didn't make sense anymore, not for me, nor for some of the people involved. Whether it was due to other projects, essentialism, differences, or any other reason, it's all right. These are natural effects of life.

As I mentioned in the [first post](https://www.edupaivadev.com/blog/ansiedade-depressao-e-pandemia/) on this blog, in 2020, I started doing live streams on Twitch. I sang a lot on an online karaoke platform called Twitch Sings, made friends, and still keep in touch with them. However, there came a time when I wasn't in the right place to provide entertainment for others. I did want to continue, but personal issues and setbacks led me away from the streams, and today, I don't see as much sense in going back to doing live streams.

I have a great affection for that time because I had a lot of fun, and those awesome live streams helped me get through the pandemic. I'm very grateful to the people who shared their time with me during that challenging phase of our lives. This is another clear example of impermanence, a period that had a beginning, middle, and end and served its purpose.

Continuing in this pandemic phase, one thing that helped me a lot were the live streams by Fresno. Want a band that has changed more than Fresno? Well, there are several, haha, like [Bring Me The Horizon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k9qDxyxS3s), [King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzcWTjY3b8Q), and [Linkin Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dmQ3QWpy1Q), but let's not deviate from the topic of the text.

I think this constant change makes a band authentic. Some may disagree and prefer bands that stick to the same sound for years, but I don't really like that idea because to me, no one remains the same for the rest of their life. I see more truth in bands that undergo a certain level of change over time. The band changes, its members change, the phase of life changes, and what we have to tell also changes.

There are narrow-minded people who associate Fresno with the emo phase (which Rick Bonadio cleverly exploited to launch various bands), but the band goes far beyond that. It has very competent members, and Lucas as the frontman is a completely insane and creative mind. This mind can offer us albums like "Ciano" in their youth and now give us records like "Sua Alegria Foi Cancelada" and "Vou Ter Que Me Virar."

It's good that these bands evolve and don't keep doing the same thing. It's good that we, as human beings, also have the space to evolve. How many times have you heard someone say in a derogatory tone, "Wow, so-and-so has changed"?

I think differently. I think, "It's great that they changed and were able to see things they didn't see before." If a person remained the same for years and years, I'm sorry, but there's something wrong there. The best friends I have today may not be the same in 10 years, and that's okay. Let's live the best moments we can here and now. I have many friends I no longer talk to, but if we meet, we'll have a lot to talk about, and we'll know that even though we've changed, we still have a deep appreciation for each other.

How many of us feel nostalgic about waking up early in childhood to have cereal or cookies with milk, watch cartoons, and more? How many miss college parties, how many long for a trip or a concert they attended? But that's how life is, a constant change. The experience comes to an end, and all we have left are memories.

It may be a hard truth to face, but when you understand that friends come and go, that work, romantic, and friendly relationships change or end, and that we, as human beings, are constantly changing, you can better appreciate the cycles and events of life.
